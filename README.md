### Accessibility

Accessible Rich Internet Applications **(ARIA)** is a set of [roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles) and [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes) that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

### WCAG 2

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) international standard, including WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.2. WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

Quick Checklist:

1. Perceivable: We can understand the meaning of whats going on. Can users detect the content with their senses (vision, hearing, etc.)? It’s about **making content available to the senses**.
2. Operable: All functions must work via keyboard. Avoid content that flashes more than 3 times/sec.
3. Understandable: Can users *comprehend* the content and how to use the interface? Eg.
    - Use clear, readable language
    - Label forms clearly
4. Robust
    - Use valid, semantic HTML.
    - Support assistive technologies (e.g., ARIA where needed).
