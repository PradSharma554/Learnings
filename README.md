Today I am going to be studying HTML tags such as &lt;p>, &lt;a>, and others.
These tags form the building blocks of web pages.
The &lt;p> tag is used for paragraphs, while the &lt;a> tag creates hyperlinks.
I’ll also explore how to structure content using tags like &lt;div>, &lt;h1>, and &lt;img>.
Understanding these will help me design and format websites better.
It’s a great step toward learning front-end web development!
